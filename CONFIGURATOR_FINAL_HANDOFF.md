# prototype/assets/

This folder holds placeholder visual assets for the LAVAL configurator prototype.

## Phase 1 status

**Empty.** Phase 1 ships with no raster assets. The mantel silhouette on the
ProtectedMantelStage is rendered as inline SVG inside `index.html` so it can
be themed via CSS variables without bundling files.

## What goes here

- Phase 3+: placeholder finish/material swatch images (small JPG or PNG, ~64×64).
- Phase 6+: lead-handoff artwork or share-card backgrounds.

## What does NOT go here

- Do not use source-application icons, sprites, textures, or extracted
  proprietary assets. Reference materials are evidence only and must not
  be copied into the LAVAL build.
- Final brand photography. That ships from the LAVAL CMS, not from the
  prototype.
- Real material swatches sourced from licensed slab inventory. Those arrive
  in the production build.

## Naming convention (for later phases)

```
finish-<family>-<id>.jpg     e.g. finish-stone-pale-limestone.jpg
swatch-<material>.png        e.g. swatch-veined-marble.png
```

All assets must be neutral, evidence-of-style placeholders only until the
production asset pipeline is approved.
